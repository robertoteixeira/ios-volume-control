## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 15+
- Swift 5

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VolumeControl.git
   cd VolumeControl

2. **Open the Project in Xcode**

Double-click on VolumeControl.xcodeproj to open the project in Xcode.

3. **Add Background Music (Optional)**

Add an audio file named background_music.mp3 to the Resources folder in the project. This file will play in the background and respond to slider volume adjustments.

4. **Build and Run**

Select an iOS simulator or connect a physical device, then click Run (or press Cmd + R) to build and launch the app.

## Usage
1. Adjust the Volume Slider: Use the sliders to adjust the background music volume. The vertical and horizontal sliders update in real time.

2. Set Custom Bar Count: Enter the number of bars you want in the bar-style slider and click "Set Bars." The app will validate the input to ensure itâ€™s a positive integer.

3. Set Progress: Enter a percentage (0 to 100) to set a specific progress level and click "Set Progress." The app updates the slider to reflect the specified progress.

## Customization
The app includes a CustomSlider SwiftUI component with several configurable properties:

- Slider Orientation: Set the slider orientation to .horizontal or .vertical.
- Slider Style: Choose between .continuous or .bar style.
- Foreground Color: Set the color of the filled portion of the slider.
- Background Color: Set the color of the unfilled portion.
- Number of Bars: Adjust the number of bars for bar-style sliders.
- Enable Haptics: Toggle haptic feedback on or off.
To modify these settings, edit the ContentView where the CustomSlider instances are initialized.
